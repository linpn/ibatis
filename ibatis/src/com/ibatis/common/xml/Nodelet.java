   *          Possible nodes are:
   *          <ul>
   *          <li>Text - Use node.getNodeValue() for the text value.
   *          <li>Attribute - Use node.getNodeValue() for the attribute value.
   *          <li>Element - This is the most flexible type. You can get the node content and iterate over the node's
   *          child nodes if neccessary. This is useful where a single XPath registration cannot describe the complex
   *          structure for a given XML stanza.
   *          </ul>
